There are several cacti which are used by the Tarahumares and other tribes
of central Mexico as substitutes for peyote. Many of these cacti are now
under investigation for their alkaloidal content and psychopharmacological
activity. Progress is somewhat retarded in the studies of the effects of 
these plants because almost all experimentation has been conducted on 
laboratory animals rather than humans. Some of these cacti have been found
to contain mescaline and other related alkaloids with known sympathomimetic
properties. Much further research is needed on these plants and their 
activity. However, we will attempt to bring the reader up to date on what is
known about them at this time.


PEYOTILLO:
This small cactus is botanically called PELECYPHORA ASELLIFORMIS. It is
also known sometimes as the hatchet cactus because of its oddly flattened
tubercules. It is often found growing in the state of San Louis Potosi in
central Mexico. The plant contains traces of mescaline too minute to have
any effect. It also contains small amounts of anhalidine, anhaladine,
hordenine, N-methylmescaline, pellotine, 3-demethyltrichocereine,
B-phenethylamine, N-methyl-B-phenethylamine, 3,4-dimethoxy-B-pheneththyl-
amine, N-methyl-3,4-dimethoxy-B-phenethylamine, and 4-methoxy-B-phenethy-
lamine. Most of these are found in peyote but in much larger quantities.

TSUWIRI:
The botanical name of this cactus is ARIOCARPUS RETUSUS. The Huichol name
tsuwiri means False Peyote. These people make long pilgrimages to the sacred
places where peyote grows in search of that sacrement. They believe that if
a person is has not been properly purified the spirits will lead him to the
False Peyote and if he partakes of it, he will suffer madness or at least a
bad trip. The plant is known among some tribes as Chautle or Chaute. These
names are also used for other Ariocarpus species. This cactus contains
hordenine, N-methyltryamine in fairly small amounts (about 0.02 percent)
and traces of N-methyl-3,4-dimethoxy-B-phenethylamine, and N-methyl-4-B-
phenethylamine. Aside from these alkaloids it also contains a flavone called
retusin (3,3',4',7-tetramethoxy-5-hydroxyflavone). Although alkaloid content
may very some at different seasons or stages of growth, from the scientific
point of view the amounts present in this plant appear insufficient to pro-
duce any psychopharmacological response.

SUNAMI:
This plant, ARIOCARPUS FISSURATUS, has been used in folkoric medicine of
Mexico and southwestern USA. It is believed to be more potent than peyote
and is used in the same manner as that cactus or made into an intoxicating
drink. Among some tribes it is known as Chaute (a generic term for Ariocarp-
us species), living rock, or dry whiskey. The latter name, however, is often
used for peyote and other psychoactive cacti. There are two varieties of
A. fissuratus: var. lloydii and var. fissuratus. Both have about the same
phytochemical makeup. The plant contains mostly hordenine, less N-methyl-
tyramine and some N-methyl-3,4-dimethoxy-B-phenethylamine. Two other species,
A. kotschoubeyanus also known as Pata De Venado or Pezuna De Venado, and A.
trigonus also contain these alkaloids.

DONANA:
This small cactus, CORYPHANTHA MACROMERIS, from northern Mexico has been 
found to contain macromerine, a phenethylamine drug reputed to have about
1/5 the potency of mescaline. It also contains normacromerine, N-formylnor-
macromerin, tyramine, N-methyltramine, hordenine, N-methyl-3,4-dimethoxy-B-
phenethylamine, metanephrine, and synephrine (a macromerine precursor).
Other coryphantha species which contain macromerine with most of these other
alkaloids include: C. pectinada, C. elephantideus, C. runyonii and C. corn-
ifera var. echinus. Most of these alkaloids with the exception of macromerine
have also been found in other varieties of C. conifera and in C. durangensis, 
C. ottonis, C. poselgeriana and C. ramillosa. Considering that there is 
usually no more than 0.1 percent macromerine in Donana and that a gram or more
of this alkaloid may be needed to produce a psychotropic effect, one would
have to consume more than a kilo of the dried cactus or 20 pounds of the
fresh plant. Clearly this is not possible for most humans. If one wishes to
experiment with the hallucinogenic properties of Donana, is is necessary 
first to make an extraction of the mixed alkaloids. Methods for this are 
given latter in this guide.

DOLICHOTHELE:
Several tribes occasionally use any one of several species of Dolichothele
as a peyote-like sacrament. These include D. baumii, D. longimamma, D.
melalenca, D. sphaerica. D. surculosa, and D. uberiforma. Recent investig-
ations have revealed in these the presence of small amounts of the alkaloids
N-methylphenethylamine, B-O-methylsynephrine, N-methyltryamine, synephrine,
hordenine, and dolichotheline (N-isovalerylhistamine).

MISCELLANEOUS:
Several other cacti have been used by the Tarahumares as peyote substitutes.
Among these are Obregonia denegrii, Aztekium ritterii, Astrophytum asterias,
A. capricorne, A. myriostigma (Bishops cap), and Solisia pectinata. The
Tarahumares also consume a cactus which they call Mulato (Mammillaria micro-
meris) and claim that it prolongs life, gives speed to runners, and clarifies
vison for mystical insights. Another cactus similarly employed is known as
Rosapara (Epitheliantha micromeris) is believed by many botanists to be the
same species as Mulato, but at a later vegetative stage. The large cactus
Pachycereus pecten-aboriginum, known locally as Cawe, has occasionally been
used as a narcotic.

What little studies have been carried out on these cacti have revealed the
presence of alkaloids most of the other species we have discussed, but no
mescaline or macromerine. Many of these alkaloids have some psychopharma-
calogical properties, but nothing to compare with those two drugs. Further-
more, the amounts of these alkaloids are usually so small as to be insignif-
icant. For example, the species Obregonia denegrii contains tyramine 0.003
percent, hordenine 0.002 percent, and N-methyltyramin 0.0002 percent.
These are all known sympathomimetics, but the percentages are far too minute
to have any value. Several publications in recent years have mentioned the
sacramental use of these cacti. As a result thousands of people have obtained
these plants from cactus dealers and ingested them, usually with disappointing
(and sometimes nauseating) results. Sadly many of these cacti are quite rare.
If too many people destroy them experimentally, they may become a seriously
endangered species. The most suitable cacti for a true psychedelic experience
are peyote, which is for the most part illegal, and several species of Tri-
chocereus (such as San Pedro), which are still legal.

SAN PEDRO:
This cactus has gained considerable fame in the past five years after 
numerous reports that it is hallucinogenic, contains mescaline, and is
readily available from cactus nurseries. This plant known botanically as
Trichocereus pachanoi, is native to the Andes of Peru and Equador. Unlike
the small peyote cactus, San Pedro is large and multi-branched. In it's
natural enviorment, it often grows to heights of 10 or 15 feet. It's 
mescaline content is less than that of peyote (0.3 - 1.2 percent), but 
because of it's great size and rapid growth, it may provide a more econom-
ical source of mescaline than peyote. One plant may easily yield several
pounds of pure mescaline upon extraction. San Pedro also contains tyramine,
hordenine, 3-methoxytyramine, anhalaninine, anhalonidine, 3,4-dimethoxyphen-
ethylamine, 3,4-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-B-phenethylamine, and 3,5-dimethoxy-4-
hydroxy-B-phenethylamine. Some of these are known sympathomimetics. Others
have no apparent effects when ingested by themselves. It is possible, how-
ever, that in combination with the mescaline and other active compounds they
may have a synergistic influence upon one another and subtly alter the qual-
itive aspects of the experience. It is also possible that any compounds in
the plant which act a mild MAO inhibitors will render a person vulnerable to
some of the above mentioned amines which would ordinarily be metabolized 
before they could take effect.

The effects of San Pedro are in many ways more pleasant than those of peyote.
To begin with, it's taste is only slightly bitter and the initial nausea is
not as likely to occur. When the full psychotropic experience takes hold it
is less overwhelming, more tranquil and not nearly as physical as that from
peyote.

San Pedro may be eaten fresh or dried and taken in any of the manners describ-
ed for peyote. Cuttings of San Pedro sold in the USA are usually about three
feet long by four inches diameter. A piece 4-8 inches long will usually bring
about the desired effect. The skin and spines must be removed. The skin 
should not be thrown away, however. The green tissue close to the skin con-
tains a high concentration of mescaline. Some people chew the skin until all
the juices are extracted. If you don't what to do this, the skins can be 
boiled in water for several hours to make a potent tea. The woody core of the
cactus cannot be eaten. One can eat around it like a corn cob. The core does
not have much alkaloid content, but can be mashed and boiled as a tea for
what little is there.

To dry San Pedro slice the cactus into disks (actually stars) 1/2 inch thick
and dry thoroughly in the sun or in an oven at 250 degrees F. The spines must
be removed either before drying or before chewing. Also one must be careful
of the splinters from the woody core. 

If a tea is made from fresh San Pedro, the cactus must be either sliced,
chopped or crushed before boiling.

San Pedro is a hardy cactus and endures cold climates quite well. It grows at
altiudes from sea level to 9000 feet high in the Andes where it is most freq-
uently found on western slopes. The soil in this region is very rich in humus
and various minerals. This helps in the production of mescaline and other
alkaloids.

There are several cacti which look much like San Pedro and have even been
mistaken for it by trained botanists. In 1960 when Turner and Heyman disc-
overed that San Pedro contained mescaline they erroneously identified the
plant as Opunita cylindtica. A few other South American species of Tricho-
cereus also contain mescaline with related alkaloids.  These include:
T. BRIDGESII, T. MACROGONUS, T.TERSCHECKII, and T. WERDERMANNIANUS.

There is evidence that the ritualistic use of San Pedro dates back to 1000 
BC. Even today it is used by Curanderos (medicine men) of northern Peru.
They prepare a drink called CIMORA from it and take this in a ceremonial 
setting to diagnose the spiritual or subconscious basis of a patient's 
illness.
